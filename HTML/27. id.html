<!-- HTML id Attribute -->
<!-- The HTML "id" attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.-->


<!-- Using the id Attribute -->
<!-- The "id" attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a stylesheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
 
The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>


<!-- Note: The id name is case sensitive!
The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces(spaces,tabs,etc.) -->




<!-- A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page. -->




<!-- HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
 
Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it. Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.-->



<!-- The "id" attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.
 
JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method.-->
