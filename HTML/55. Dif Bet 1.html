<!-- Difference between <canvas> and <svg> tag in html -->

<!-- The <canvas> and <svg> tags in HTML are both used for drawing graphics, but they have different use cases and underlying technologies. Hereâ€™s a comparison to help you understand their differences:

<canvas> Tag
Type: Raster-based (pixel-based).
Rendering: Uses JavaScript to draw graphics on the fly.
Performance: Better for dynamic, high-performance graphics like games and real-time visualizations.
Scalability: Poor scalability; resizing can lead to pixelation.
Manipulation: Graphics are drawn into a single canvas element and cannot be accessed or modified individually once drawn.
Use Case: Ideal for complex animations, game graphics, and real-time data visualizations.



<svg> Tag
Type: Vector-based (shape-based).
Rendering: Uses XML to define graphics.
Performance: Better for static or less frequently changing graphics.
Scalability: Excellent scalability; can be resized without loss of quality.
Manipulation: Each element is part of the DOM and can be styled, scripted, and manipulated individually.
Use Case: Ideal for logos, icons, and graphics that require high scalability and precision. -->




<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  ctx.fillStyle = 'green';
  ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);
</script>


<svg width="200" height="200">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="150" height="100" fill="green" />
</svg>




<!-- Key Differences
Scalability: SVG scales better than Canvas.
Performance: Canvas is better for high-performance graphics.
Manipulation: SVG elements can be manipulated individually, while Canvas elements cannot once drawn.
Complexity: SVG is more suitable for simpler, static graphics, while Canvas is better for complex, dynamic graphics. -->
