<!-- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. -->

<!-- 
HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browser automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.


You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

<!-- 
HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
-->


    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr>


<!-- 
HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
-->
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>







<!-- <wbr> Element -->
<!-- The <wbr> (Word Break Opportunity) tag specifies where in a text it would be ok to add a line-break.

Tip: When a word is too long, the browser might break it at the wrong place. You can use the <wbr> element to add word break opportunities. -->
