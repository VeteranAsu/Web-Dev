<!-- A Simple HTML Document -->
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
 </body>
 </html>

 <!-- 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
 -->

<!-- HTML Elements
 An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. 
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
