<!-- 2. Or, with the title attribute added: -->
<p><dfn title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</dfn> is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</p>


<!-- 3. Or, with an <abbr> tag inside the <dfn> element: -->
<p><dfn><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></dfn> is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</p>


<!-- 4. Or, with the id attribute added. Then, whenever a term is used, it can refer back to the definition with an <a> tag: -->
