<!-- HTML Encoding (Character Sets) -->
<!-- To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use. -->



<!-- What is encoding?
The mechanism of converting data into an equivalent
cipher using specific code called encoding. -->



<!-- ASCII is the acronym for
the American Standard Code
for Information Interchange. It is a
code for representing 128
English characters as numbers, with
each letter assigned a number from 0
to 127. -->



<!-- ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange)
Indian Script Code for Information Interchange (ISCII) In order to facilitate the use of Indian
languages on computers, a common standard for coding Indian scripts called ISCII was
developed in India during mid 1980s.
It is an 8-bit code representation for Indian languages which means it can represent
28=256 characters.
It retains all 128 ASCII codes and uses rest of the codes (128) for additional Indian language
character set.
Additional codes have been assigned in the upper region (160-255) for the 'aksharas' of
the language. -->


<!-- HTML charset Attribute -->
<!-- The charcter set is specified in the <meta> tag. -->

<meta charset="UTF-8">

<!-- The full form of UTF in UTF-8 is "Unicode Transformation Format". -->

<!-- The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.
 
UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
-->



<!-- The ASCII Character Set -->
<!-- ASCII was the first character encoding standard for the web. It defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet:
English letters (A-Z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters like ! $ + - () @ < >.

<!-- 
Unicode(International encoding standard) is Two - Byte (16- Bits)character code set that has characters
representing almost all characters in almost all human alphabets and writing system. Around the world
including English, Chinese and Many More.
It's a latest coding system of the characters followed word wide is known as Unicode.
A Unicode is standard encoding system created by Unicode consortium that is used to encode a character in
any computer language.
June 2018 the most recent version, Unicode 11.0, contains a repertoire of 137,439 characters covering 146
modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji.
Ken Thomson developed it.
Commonly used UNICODE encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. It is a superset of ASCII, and the value
0-128 have the same character as in ASCII.
