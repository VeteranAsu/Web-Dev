<!-- HTML Video -->
<!-- The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page. -->

<!-- To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element. -->
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="birds.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<br> <br>


<!-- How it works -->
<!-- The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
 
It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternate video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element. -->





<!-- HTML <video> autoplay -->
<!-- To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute.-->

<video height="240" width="320" autoplay controls>
    <source src="bunnies.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> <br><br>

<!-- Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed. -->






<!-- Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted) -->
 <video height="240" width="320" autoplay muted controls>
    <source src="dogs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 </video>




 <!-- HTML <track> tag -->
<!-- HTML <track> tag is used to define time-based text tracks for a media file. The <track> tag must use as child element of <audio> and <video> elements.

The <track> tag is used to add subtitle, caption, or any other form of text which displayed when a media file plays.

HTML <track> is new tag in HTML5. -->
