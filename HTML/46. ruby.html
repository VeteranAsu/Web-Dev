<!-- HTML <ruby> Tag -->
<!-- The <ruby> tag specifies a ruby annotation.

A ruby annotation is a small extra text, attached to the main text to indicate the pronunciation or meaning of the corresponding characters. This kind of annotation is often used in Japanese publications.

Use <ruby> together with <rt>, <rb> and <rp>: The <ruby> element consists of one or more characters that needs an explanation/pronunciation, and an <rt> element that gives that information, and an optional <rp> element that defines what to show for browsers that do not support ruby annotations. By <rb> tag you can define the main text. -->
