<!-- The Head Element -->
<!-- The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <styles>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.-->



<!-- The HTML <head> Element -->
<!-- The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body tag>.
    
HTML metadata is data about the HMTL document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character, set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
-->





<!-- The HTML <title> Element -->
<!-- The <title> element defines the title of the docuement. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
    
The <title> element is required in HTML documents!

The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimizatio (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:
1. defines a title in the browser toolbar
2. provides a title for the page when it is added to favourites
3. displays a title for the page in search engine-results

So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!-->







<!-- The HTML <style> Element -->
<!-- The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page. -->







<!-- The HTML <link> Element -->
<!-- The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resourse.
 
The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets.-->





<!-- The HTML <meta> Element -->
<!-- The <meta> element is typically used to specify the characterset, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
 
The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.-->

<!-- Examples
define the character set used:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

define keywords for search engines:
<meta name="keywords", content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">

define a description of your web page:
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">

define the author of a page:
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">

refresh document every 30 seconds:
<meta http-equiv="refresh", content="30">

setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
-->


<!-- Setting The Viewport -->
<!-- The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
 
You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width", initial-scale="1.0"> 

This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part set the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
-->






<!-- The HTML <script> Element -->
<!-- The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts. -->





<!-- The HTML <base> Element -->
<!-- The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.
 
The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.

There can be one single <base> element in a document! -->

<!-- The <isindex> tag in HTML was used to create a single-line text input field for querying a document. However, itâ€™s important to note that this tag has been deprecated in HTML 4.01 and removed entirely from HTML5 standards.
    
Since the <isindex> tag is obsolete, you should use the <form> and <input> elements to achieve similar functionality.
