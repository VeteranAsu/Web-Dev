<!-- 
HTML Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
 
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property.-->

<h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>




 
    
<!-- <hgroup> tag -->
<!-- The <hgroup> tag is used to surround a heading and one or more <p> elements.

The heading inside the <hgroup> element can be any of the <h1> to <h6> headings.

Note: The <hgroup> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <hgroup> element and its content. -->

    <hgroup style="color: red;">
        <h2>Norway</h2>
        <h3>Argentina</h3>
        <h2>Finland</h2>
        <h3>India</h3>
    </hgroup>
