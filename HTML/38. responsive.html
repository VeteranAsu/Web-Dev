<!-- HTML Responsive Web Design -->
<!-- Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices! -->
<!-- A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports. -->
<!-- Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). -->



<!-- Setting the Viewport -->
<!-- To create a responsive website, add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 
This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.-->




<!-- Responsive Images -->
<!-- Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size. 
 
Using the width property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down.-->
<img src="images/tajmahal.webp" alt="tajmahal" style="width: 100%;">

<!-- Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution,in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. -->

<!-- Using the max-width Property -->
<!-- If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size. -->
<img src="images/tajmahal.webp" alt="tajmahal" style="max-width: 100%;height: auto;">





<!-- Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width -->
<!-- The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. -->





<!-- Responsive Text Size -->
<!-- The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport-width". -->
<h1 style="font-size: 10vw;">Hello World</h1>

<!-- Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm. -->







<!-- Media Queries -->
<!-- In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
 
With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
-->

<style>
    * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    .left {
        background-color: #2196f3;
        padding: 20px;
        float: left;
        width: 20%;
    }

    .main {
        background-color: #f1f1f1;
        padding: 20px;
        float: left;
        width: 60%;
    }

    .right {
        background-color: #4AA66D;
        padding: 20px;
        float: left;
        width: 20%;
    }

    @media  screen and (max-width: 800px) {
        .left, .main, .right{
            width: 100%;
        }
    }
</style>

<h2>Media Queries</h2>
<p>Resize the browser window.</p>

<p>Make sure you reach the breakpoint at 800px when resizing this frame.</p>

</div>

<div class="main">
    <p>Main Content</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
