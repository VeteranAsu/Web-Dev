/* CSS Selectors */

/* A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style. 

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specifice relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)*/


/* The CSS element Selector */
/* The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.*/

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}





/* The CSS id selector */
/* The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. 

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.*/

#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}






/* The CSS class Selector */
/* The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.*/

.center{
    text-align: center;
    color: aqua;
}


/* You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. */

p.center{
    text-align: center;
    color: blueviolet;
}






/* The CSS Universal Selector */
/* The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page. */

* {
    text-align: left;
    color: rgb(27, 241, 27);
}








/* The CSS Grouping Selector */
/* The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style defintions.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma*/
