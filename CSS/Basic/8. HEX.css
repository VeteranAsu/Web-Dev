/* CSS HEX Colors  */

/* A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal intergers specify the components of the color. */



/* HEX Color Values  */

/* In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb

where rr (red), gg (green), bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

for example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.

Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.

another example, #0000ff is displayed as blue, because blue is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and green) are set to 00.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff. */




/* Shades of Gray  */

/* Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters like #404040, #686868, #a0a0a0, #bebebe, #dcdcdc, #f8f8f8 etc. */
