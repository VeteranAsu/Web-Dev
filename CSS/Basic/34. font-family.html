    <p>Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website. The right font can create a strong identity for your brand. Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.</p>

    <pre>
        In CSS there are five generic font families:

        Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
        Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
        Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
        Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
        Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
    </pre>

    <p>Note: If the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".</p>

    <p class="ex1">The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available).</p>
