/* CSS HSL and HSLA colors  */

/* HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with a Alpha channel (opacity). */




/* HSL Color Values  */

/* In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form.

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.

example:
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
hsl(147, 50%, 47%)
hsl(300, 76%, 72%)
hsl(39, 100%, 50%)
hsl(248, 53%, 58%) */




/* Saturation */

/* Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. 100% is pure color, no shades of gray. 50% is 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color. 0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.

example;
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
hsl(0, 80%, 50%)
hsl(0, 60%, 50%)
hsl(0, 40%, 50%)
hsl(0, 20%, 50%)
hsl(0, 0%, 50%) */





/* Lightness  */

/* The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full lightness (white).

example:
hsl(0, 100%, 0%)
hsl(0, 100%, 25%)
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
hsl(0, 100%, 75%)
hsl(0, 100%, 90%)
hsl(0, 100%, 100%) */





/* Shades of Gray  */

/* Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:

example:
hsl(0, 0%, 20%)
hsl(0, 0%, 30%)
hsl(0, 0%, 40%)
hsl(0, 0%, 60%)
hsl(0, 0%, 70%)
hsl(0, 0%, 90%)  */




/* HSLA Color Values  */

/* HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with:
hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).

example:
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.4)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.6)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.8)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1) */
