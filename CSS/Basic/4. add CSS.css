/* How To Add CSS */
/* When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet. */


/* Three Ways to Insert CSS */
/* There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS
*/



/* External CSS */
/* With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.*/



/* Internal CSS */
/* An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique sytle.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.*/



/* Inline CSS */
/* An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.*/




/* Multiple Style Sheets */
/* If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. */





/* Cascading Order */
/* What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element? */

/* 
All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority::after

1. Inline style (inside the HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default
